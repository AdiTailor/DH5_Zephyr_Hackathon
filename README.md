Of course. A great README is crucial for teamwork, especially in a hackathon. You've done the hard work of getting the foundation laid; now let's document it so your team can hit the ground running.

Here is a complete `README.md` file. Just copy and paste this into the `README.md` file in your project's root directory.

# MindSpace üß†‚ú®

*A safe space for self-reflection and anonymous peer support. Built for the DH5 Zephyr Hackathon.*

---

## üöÄ Problem Statement

Mental health challenges are often hidden due to stigma. Students need a safe, anonymous, and accessible digital space to reflect on their thoughts, connect with peers, and seek support without fear of judgment. MindSpace is a full-stack web application designed to be that space.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Our stack is chosen for rapid development, performance, and a modern user experience.

| Technology      | Purpose                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Next.js** | Full-stack React Framework            |
| **React** | UI Library                            |
| **TypeScript** | Static Typing for Code Quality        |
| **Tailwind CSS**| Utility-First CSS Framework         |
| **Shadcn/UI** | Re-usable UI Components               |
| **Supabase** | Backend-as-a-Service (Auth & DB)      |

## ‚úÖ Current Status (As of 1:30 AM Saturday)

The foundation is solid and the core user loop is **complete**. Here's what's working right now:

* **Project Setup:** The Next.js project is fully configured with all necessary dependencies.
* **Database Schema:** All tables (`profiles`, `journal_entries`, `community_posts`) are created and configured in Supabase with Row Level Security.
* **Authentication:** A complete authentication flow is working. Users can sign in anonymously, and the session is managed securely.
* **Journal Feature:** The private journaling feature is **fully functional**. Logged-in users can create new journal entries with mood selections and view their past entries.

## üèÅ Getting Started: A Guide for the Team

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, get the code onto your machine.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mindspace-app
````

### 2\. Install Dependencies

This will install all the necessary packages.

```bash
npm install
```

### 3\. Set Up Environment Variables (CRITICAL)

The project needs to connect to our Supabase backend.

1.  Ask the team member who set up the Supabase project to share two secret keys: the **Project URL** and the **`anon` public key**.
2.  In the root of the project, create a new file named `.env.local`.
3.  Copy the following into that file and paste the shared keys:

<!-- end list -->

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL='PASTE_THE_SUPABASE_URL_HERE'
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY='PASTE_THE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_HERE'
```

**Note:** The app will not start without this file.

### 4\. Run the Development Server

You're all set\! Run this command to start the app.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap & Next Steps

Here is the plan for the rest of the hackathon. Let's divide and conquer these features.

### Priority 1: Community Feed Feature

  * **Goal:** Allow users to post anonymous messages and interact with them.
  * **Tasks:**
      * `[ ]` **Build the UI:** Create the `(app)/community/page.tsx` file.
      * `[ ]` **Create Components:** Build `CommunityPostForm.tsx` and `PostCard.tsx` inside `components/features/community/`.
      * `[ ]` **Implement Server Action:** Create a server action to save new posts to the `community_posts` table in Supabase.
      * `[ ]` **Fetch and Display Posts:** Load all posts from Supabase and display them on the page.

### Priority 2: Dashboard Visualization

  * **Goal:** Show users insightful data about their mood trends.
  * **Tasks:**
      * `[ ]` **Build the UI:** Flesh out the `(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` file.
      * `[ ]` **Data Fetching:** Create the server-side logic to fetch and aggregate mood data from the `journal_entries` table.
      * `[ ]` **Create Chart Component:** Build a `MoodChart.tsx` component using `recharts` to display a line or bar chart of mood history.

### Stretch Goal: AI Sentiment Analysis

  * **Goal:** Provide automated insights on journal entries.
  * **Tasks:**
      * `[ ]` **Python Microservice:** Set up a simple Flask API that takes text and returns a sentiment score using a library like Hugging Face's `transformers`.
      * `[ ]` **API Integration:** When a journal entry is saved, call this new microservice from our Next.js backend and store the sentiment score in the database.

Let's get some rest and hit this hard in the morning. We've got a great foundation. Let's win this\!
